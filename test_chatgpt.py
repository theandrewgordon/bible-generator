Return valid JSON with:
- "verse": the reference
- "fullVerse": the full Bible verse (from the {version.upper()}), without the reference text, Capiitalize first letter
- "traceableVerse": If fullVerse has 26 words or fewer, the full Bible verse (from the {version.upper()}), without the reference text, Capiitalize first letter. Otherwise, return a meaningful excerpt (under 27 words). Capiitalize first letter
- "handwritingLines": 3
- "reflectionQuestion": one simple life-application question
- "imageIdea": a coloring prompt based on the verse (e.g. a shepherd, cross, prayer hands, etc.)
- "version": "{version.lower()}"

Formatting rules:
- If the verse has quotes inside the verse (not surrounding it), don't remove them but dont add them outside verse, if you add a quote, must open and close quote, always use Unicode directional quotes: \\u201c \\u201d for double quotes, \\u2018 \\u2019 for single quotes.
- Do NOT use ASCII straight quotes (" or ')
- Do NOT add spaces before punctuation
- Capitalize all pronouns that refer to God/Jesus (e.g., He, His, Him), example: ("but God shows His love", "And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to His purpose.", "We love because He first loved us.")
- Return JSON only. No explanations.
