``URLObject`` is a utility class for manipulating URLs. The latest
incarnation of this library builds upon the ideas of its predecessor,
but aims for a clearer API, focusing on proper method names over
operator overrides. It's also being developed from the ground up in a
test-driven manner, and has full Sphinx documentation.

Installation

URLObject is hosted on PyPI_. Install it using ``pip``:

.. code:: sh

    pip install URLObject
